        This API will be accepting different components of the ad/page and will be automatically validating the components and send back the policy violations if any. We recommend to send all components of the same entity to be sent together. It will make us better detect any policy violation if present. This will increase the Time to go live for the entity. In one request please don't send the components of more than one entity.
