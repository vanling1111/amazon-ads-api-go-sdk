If Amazon is unable to translate them, the ad will be rejected by moderation. We only support translating headlines and videos from English to German, French, Italian, Spanish, Japanese, and Dutch. See developer notes for more information.

At a future state, existing mediaIds will be added to Asset library for use in SB campaigns.
