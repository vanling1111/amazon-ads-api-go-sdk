// Response object for /sb/targets/categories/{categoryRefinementId}/refinements containing information on Brand Nodes, Age Range Nodes, and Genre Nodes.     Response is paginated with pagination occurring for all three arrays at once.     Example: If there are 800 brands, 5 age ranges, and 600 genres, the first response will return 500 brands, 5 age ranges, and 500 genres. The next paginated response will return 300 brands, 0 age ranges, and 100 genres.
