package advertisingaccounts

// Status : The current state of the account. Statuses include Pending, Partially Created, Created, and Disabled. If the account is in pending, it's registration is in progress and you'll need to call back again for an updated status. Partially Created means that the account is registered for some, but not all marketplaces, and the user may proceed with their global account for those marketplaces. Created means that it has been fully registered, and Disabled means that the account is no longer accessible.
