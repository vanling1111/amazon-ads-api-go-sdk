// ForecastStatus : It contains the forecast status. The IMPRESSION_TARGETING_TOO_NARROW field means the targeting  clauses are too narrow, and the IMPRESSION_TARGETING_TOO_BROAD field means the targeting clauses are too broad,  so our inventory impression forecast won't provide any useful information. The COMPLETE field means all the forecasts are complete.
