Audience IDs are guaranteed to be unique across all audience types, enabling this inference. | Value               | Description| |---------------------|------------| | `SPONSORED_ADS_AMC` | This type refers to the Audience Segments created in AMC for Sponsored Ads. See [AMC API](https://advertising.amazon.com/API/docs/en-us/amc-rba#tag/Rule-based-audience) for details on how to create AMC Audiences.
