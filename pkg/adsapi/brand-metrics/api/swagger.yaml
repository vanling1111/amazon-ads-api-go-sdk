  title: Brand Metrics
  description: "Brand Metrics provides a new measurement solution that quantifies\
    \ opportunities for your brand at each stage of the customer journey on Amazon,\
    \ and helps brands understand the value of different shopping engagements that\
    \ impact stages of that journey. You can now access Awareness and Consideration\
    \ indices that compare your performance to peers using models predictive of consideration\
    \ and sales. Brand Metrics quantifies the number of customers in the awareness\
    \ and consideration marketing funnel stages and is built at scale to measure all\
    \ shopping engagements with your brand on Amazon, not just ad-attributed engagements.\
    \ Additionally, BM breaks out key shopping engagements at each stage of the shopping\
    \ journey, along with the Return on Engagement, so you can measure the historical\
    \ sales following a consideration event or purchase."
