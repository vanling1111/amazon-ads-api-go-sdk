Data is available from August 30, 2017. <br> \"VISITORS\" metric currently can only be aggregated by InsightDimension \"Date\". Users won't be able to get this metric when specifying other InsightDimensions. This is because number of visitors are measured at store level. This also means this metric won't be impacted by the InsightFilter.  * `SCORE_LEVEL` This metric is for Store Quality rating calculated on various factors defining the quality of a store. It can be `HIGH`, `MEDIUM` or `LOW`.

For Ex (Add best-selling products).   7. `ctaLink` is th CTA (Call to Action) link where Advertisers can log-in to Store builder and add the mentioned recommendations.   8. `observedAverageDwellTimeIncrease`, is the improvement it might bring in the overall store quality.  * `CONTRIBUTORS` This metric is the array of recommendations applied by the Store Owner which resulted in the improvement of overall store quality. This metric currently can only be aggregated by InsightDimension \"DATE\".  * `DWELL` This metric is the time a customer spends on the store, on an average. This metric is specifically for the store quality and mesasures the time spent by a shoping customer on the store This is calculated differently from \"DWELL_TIME\". This metric currently can only be aggregated by InsightDimension \"DATE\".   * `PEER_DWELL` This metric is the time a customer spends on other similar (peer) stores on an average. This metric currently can only be aggregated by InsightDimension \"DATE\".  * `COMPLETED_RECOMMENDATIONS` This metric is an Array of Object containing 6 fields.    1. `recommendedAction` is a description of recommendation (for example `Add a video`).  2. `recommendedActionId` is an Id of each element in the array.   3. `category` This field is a category in which Advertisers may see improvements.

For aggregation at store level, *dimension* must be ommited from the request.  * `BOUNCE_RATE` This metric provides insights into visitor engagement by measuring the ratio of total bounce visits(customer who landed on the store and left quickly without engaging) to total landing visits. It provides insights into user interaction, available at both page and store levels. <br> \"BOUNCE_RATE\" metric can be aggregated by all the InsightDimensions or at the store level. For aggregation at store level, *dimension* must be ommited from the request.  * `NEW_TO_STORE` This metric reports the total count of unique visitors who are new to the store, providing valuable insights into the number of first-time shoppers. <br> \"NEW_TO_STORE\" metric currently can only be aggregated by InsightDimension \"DATE\" or at the store level. For aggregation at store level, *dimension* must be ommited from the request.  * `ACTIONS_TAKEN_BY_PEERS` This metric informs about the number of recommendations customer's peer stores have taken on an average. This is helpful in relating it with the `PEER_DWELL` time.  * `VIDEO_STARTED` This is calculated by dividing the visit with video started by Total Page Visits.  * `VIDEO_10S_PLAYED` The number of visits where the shopper watched the complete video or 10 seconds, whichever is shorter.  * `VIDEO_25P_PLAYED` The number of visits where the video was viewed to 25%.  * `VIDEO_50P_PLAYED` The number of visits where the video was viewed to 50%.  * `VIDEO_75P_PLAYED` The number of visits where the video was viewed to 75%.  * `VIDEO_COMPLETED` The number of visits where the video was viewed to 100%.
