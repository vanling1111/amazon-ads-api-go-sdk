 * Partner Opportunities
 *
 * <br><br>**Purpose of the API**<br><br>The API is for partners to retrieve **'opportunities'** relevant to optimizing their book of business. Opportunities are actionable insights for partners that drive value to advertisers.<br><br>For a step by step guide to using our API, we recommend our official [developer guide](https://advertising.amazon.com/API/docs/en-us/guides/recommendations/partner-opportunities/overview).<br><br>**How should partners use this set of APIs?**<br><br>Partners should use this set of APIs by first calling the **GET** `/partnerOpportunities` route to obtain a list of opportunities that are pertinent (and exclusive) to their book of business (the advertisers they manage).<br><br>It should be noted that the opportunities returned in this list call may not have data for that day (opportunities are updated every 24 hours). To check if an opportunity has data, introspect on the value of the `opportunities[].dataMetadata.rowCount` field. If the value is greater than zero, data is available and a data file can be downloaded.<br><br>Once an opportunity of interest has been identified, the given opportunity data can be downloaded using the **GET** `/partnerOpportunities/{partnerOpportunityId}/file` route, which will redirect to a pre-signed file download URL containing all opportunity data in a CSV format. This operation will return a 404 if no data is available for the given opportunity.<br><br>Partners can get aggregated information about opportunities available to them using the **GET** `/partnerOpportunities/summary` route. This information includes total opportunity count, count of opportunities with data available to be downloaded, and a count of unique advertisers across all opportunities. <br><br>**Required Headers**<br><br>Currently, there are two headers that are required for all API calls. If these headers are not correctly provided and properly formatted, the API call requests will fail.<br><br>1. `Accept:` Must be set to a supported API version (see below), using the format described on the [Advertising API portal](https://advertising.amazon.com/API/docs/en-us/concepts/compatibility-versioning-policy). The request and response payloads are identical between versions v1, v1.1, and v1.2.<br>    - Version 1 (Recommended): `'application/vnd.partneropportunity.v1+json'`<br>    - Version 1.1: `'application/vnd.partneropportunity.v1.1+json'`<br>    - Version 1.2: `'application/vnd.partneropportunity.v1.2+json'`<br>  <br>2. `Amazon-Advertising-API-Manager-Account:` 'Partner Network Account ID' which is accessible from Partner Network under the ['User settings'](https://advertising.amazon.com/partner-network/settings) link in the upper right corner.<br>    - Example: `'amzn1.ads1.ma1.abcd1234...'`<br><br>**Applying Opportunities**<br>Partners can take action against opportunities based on their business needs. For example, partners may choose to use existing Advertising API resources to launch new ASINs or modify campaign settings. Some entries in your opportunity data file will have `recommendationId`s and `applyApiEndPoint`s. These opportunities will have objective type `AMAZON_ACCOUNT_TEAM_RECOMMENDATIONS` and can be supplied back to the `/apply` endpoint to programmatically take action on each opportunity.<br><br>See [How to use the Partner Opportunities API](https://advertising.amazon.com/API/docs/en-us/guides/recommendations/partner-opportunities/how-to) for additional details. <br><br>**Advanced Usage**<br><br>**Pagination**<br><br>The `/partnerOpportunities` route supports pagination of results via query parameters. <br><br>**GET** `/partnerOpportunities` calls support using *optional* query parameters `maxResults` and `nextToken` for paginated requests and responses. <br>**GET** `/partnerOpportunities` responses include tokens which can be used to navigate to the first, previous, next, and last pages of results. To navigate to the desired page, pass one of these provided tokens as a query parameter for the next call to **GET** `/partnerOpportunities`.<br><br>Examples:<br>- **GET** `/partnerOpportunities?maxResults=10` will return 10 opportunities and a valid series of pagination tokens.<br>- **GET** `/partnerOpportunities?maxResults=10&nextToken=[next-page-token]` will get the next 10 opportunities. <br><br>**Filtering**<br><br>The `/partnerOpportunities` and `/partnerOpportunities/summary` routes support filtering results via query parameters.<br><br>**GET** `/partnerOpportunities` calls support using *optional* query parameters `audience`, `objectiveType`, `product`, `advertiserId`, and `profileId` for filtering responses.<br>**GET** `/partnerOpportunities` responses will include only opportunities which have values matching the requested filters. If no filters are specified, all opportunities are returned.<br><br>Examples:<br>- **GET** `/partnerOpportunities?objectiveType=UNLAUNCHED_ASINS&product=AMAZON_DSP,SPONSORED_PRODUCTS` will return all opportunities which have a `objectiveType` of `UNLAUNCHED_ASINS` and a `product` of `AMAZON_DSP` OR `SPONSORED_PRODUCTS`.<br>- **GET** `/partnerOpportunities?advertiserId=A12345,B67890` will return all opportunities that contain data for `advertiserId` `A12345` OR `B67890`.<br>- **GET** `/partnerOpportunities?profileId=12345,67890` will return all opportunities that contain data for `profileId` `12345` OR `67890`.<br>- **GET** `/partnerOpportunities?advertiserId=A12345,B67890&profileId=12345,67890` will return all opportunities that contain data for `advertiserId` `A12345` OR `B67890` OR `profileId` `12345` OR `67890`.<br><br>**GET** `/partnerOpportunities/summary` calls support using *optional* query parameters `audience`, `objectiveType`, and `product` for filtering responses.<br>**GET** `/partnerOpportunities/summary` responses will include metadata for the filter values for opportunities under the `availableAudiences`, `availableObjectiveTypes`, etc. fields. This metadata will include the available filter values along with the number of opportunities for those filter values.<br><br>Examples:<br>- **GET** `/partnerOpportunities/summary?product=SPONSORED_PRODUCTS` will provide a summary of all opportunities that have a `product` value of `SPONSORED_PRODUCTS`.<br><br>**Localization**<br><br>The `/partnerOpportunities` route supports a `locale` query parameter for retrieving opportunities in a localized manner.<br><br>**GET** `/partnerOpportunities` calls support the *optional* query parameter `locale` for localizing responses.<br>**GET** `/partnerOpportunities` responses will be localized to the requested `locale` if possible and filtered out if not.<br><br>Example:<br>- **GET** `/partnerOpportunities?locale=zh_CN` to request opportunity responses localized in Chinese.<br><br>**Additional Resources**<br><br>For more information on **CURL** command formatting, please see [the Amazon Ads Website](https://advertising.amazon.com/API/docs/en-us/getting-started/first-call).<br>
