If the path expires before the report is downloaded, a new report request must be created.   **To understand the call flow for asynchronous reports, see [Getting started with sponsored ads reports](/API/docs/en-us/guides/reporting/v2/sponsored-ads-reports).**  The report file contains one row per entity for which performance data is present.

# **V2HsaRecordTypeReportPost**
> InlineResponse20018 V2HsaRecordTypeReportPost(ctx, body, amazonAdvertisingAPIClientId, amazonAdvertisingAPIScope, recordType)
Requests the creation of a report containing performance data related to Sponsored Brands campaigns.

Use this interface to request and retrieve performance reports. **To understand the call flow for asynchronous reports, see [Getting started with sponsored ads reports](/API/docs/en-us/guides/reporting/v2/sponsored-ads-reports).**  **KDP support**  Note that KDP profiles cannot currently request reports for Sponsored Brands campaigns using the API. Authors should use the advertising console to download reporting data.   **Filtering**  For more information, see the [Reporting FAQ](/API/docs/en-us/guides/reporting/v2/faq#can-i-filter-a-sponsored-brands-report).  **Constraints of Sponsored Brands reporting**  Sponsored Brands reporting data cannot be combined with Sponsored Products data into one report. Only 14-day data is available for Sponsored Brands. Attribution windows of 1, 7, and 30-day intervals are not available.  **New-to-brand performance metrics**  With new-to-brand metrics, advertisers can measure and optimize campaigns, as well as plan future marketing strategies to grow their customer base on Amazon. New-to-brand metrics determine whether an ad-attributed purchase was made by an existing customer or one buying a brandâ€™s product on Amazon for the first time over the prior year. With new-to-brand metrics, advertisers receive campaign performance metrics such as total new-to-brand purchases and sales, new-to-brand purchase rate, and cost per new-to-brand customer. Advertisers now have the tools they need to estimate the cost of acquiring new customers on Amazon and identify the most efficient channels and tactics to achieve their campaign goals.
