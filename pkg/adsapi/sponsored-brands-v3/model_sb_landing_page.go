package sponsoredbrandsv3

// Specifies either an array of ASINs for a simple landing page or the URL of a Store page. Vendors may also specify the URL of a custom landing page. Shoppers are sent to the specified simple landing page, custom landing page, or Store page when the ad is clicked. Note that this property can be updated when the campaign is in a draft state, but can't be updated while the campaign is in moderation or once it's been approved. If the campaign is rejected for any reason, it returns to a draft state.
