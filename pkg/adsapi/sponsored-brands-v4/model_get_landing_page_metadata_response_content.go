	// A canonical URL is the URL that represents the best version of landing page URL from a group of duplicate landing page URLs. For example, if you have two landing page URLs for the same page (such as amazon.it/HSA/pages/default?pageId=B59A592C-8A12-4684-A37E-2416FD594D87 and amazon.it/stores/page/B59A592C-8A12-4684-A37E-2416FD594D87), we chooses one as canonical. In this case, canonical url is amazon.it/stores/page/B59A592C-8A12-4684-A37E-2416FD594D87
	CanonicalUrl string `json:"canonicalUrl"`
