Opportunities are actionable insights for partners that drive value to advertisers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor a step by step guide to using our API, we recommend our official [developer guide](https://advertising.amazon.com/API/docs/en-us/guides/recommendations/partner-opportunities/overview).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e**How should partners use this set of APIs?**\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePartners should use this set of APIs by first calling the **GET** `/partnerOpportunities` route to obtain a list of opportunities that are pertinent (and exclusive) to their book of business (the advertisers they manage).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt should be noted that the opportunities returned in this list call may not have data for that day (opportunities are updated every 24 hours). To check if an opportunity has data, introspect on the value of the `opportunities[].dataMetadata.rowCount` field. If the value is greater than zero, data is available and a data file can be downloaded.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce an opportunity of interest has been identified, the given opportunity data can be downloaded using the **GET** `/partnerOpportunities/{partnerOpportunityId}/file` route, which will redirect to a pre-signed file download URL containing all opportunity data in a CSV format. This operation will return a 404 if no data is available for the given opportunity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePartners can get aggregated information about opportunities available to them using the **GET** `/partnerOpportunities/summary` route. This information includes total opportunity count, count of opportunities with data available to be downloaded, and a count of unique advertisers across all opportunities. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e**Required Headers**\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, there are two headers that are required for all API calls.

For example, partners may choose to use existing Advertising API resources to launch new ASINs or modify campaign settings. Some entries in your opportunity data file will have `recommendationId`s and `applyApiEndPoint`s. These opportunities will have objective type `AMAZON_ACCOUNT_TEAM_RECOMMENDATIONS` and can be supplied back to the `/apply` endpoint to programmatically take action on each opportunity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSee [How to use the Partner Opportunities API](https://advertising.amazon.com/API/docs/en-us/guides/recommendations/partner-opportunities/how-to) for additional details. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e**Advanced Usage**\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e**Pagination**\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe `/partnerOpportunities` route supports pagination of results via query parameters. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e**GET** `/partnerOpportunities` calls support using *optional* query parameters `maxResults` and `nextToken` for paginated requests and responses. \u003cbr\u003e**GET** `/partnerOpportunities` responses include tokens which can be used to navigate to the first, previous, next, and last pages of results.
