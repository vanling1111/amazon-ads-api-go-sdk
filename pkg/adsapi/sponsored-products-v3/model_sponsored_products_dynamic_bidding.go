type SponsoredProductsDynamicBidding struct {
	PlacementBidding []SponsoredProductsPlacementBidding `json:"placementBidding,omitempty"`
	// Specifies Shopper Cohorts based bid adjustment controls. `shopperCohortBidding` is optional for both Create and Update requests. You can enable this control to adjust your bid based on the shopper cohorts. The percentage value set is the percentage of the original bid including any other bid adjustments such as `placementBidding`. For example, a `placementBidding` with 50% adjustment on a $1.00 bid would increase the bid to $1.50, and a `shopperCohortBidding` with 100% adjustment would further increase the bid to $3.00.
