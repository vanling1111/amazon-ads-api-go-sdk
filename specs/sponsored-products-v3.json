Shopper Cohorts based bid adjustment controls. `shopperCohortBidding` is optional for both Create and Update requests.\nYou can enable this control to adjust your bid based on the shopper cohorts. The percentage value set is the percentage of the original bid including any other bid adjustments such as `placementBidding`. For example, a `placementBidding` with 50% adjustment on a $1.00 bid would increase the bid to $1.50, and a `shopperCohortBidding` with 100% adjustment would further increase the bid to $3.00.","items":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/SponsoredProductsShopperCohortBidding"},"maxItems":1,"minItems":0,"type":"array"},"strategy":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/SponsoredProductsBiddingStrategy"}},"required":["strategy"],"type":"object"},"SponsoredProductsEntityNotFoundError":{"properties":{"cause":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/SponsoredProductsErrorCause"},"entityId":{"description":"The entity id in the request","type":"string"},"entityType":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/SponsoredProductsEntityType"},"message":{"description":"Human readable error message","type":"string"},"reason":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/SponsoredProductsEntityNotFoundErrorReason"}},"required":["entityId","entityType","message","reason"],"type":"object"},"SponsoredProductsEntityNotFoundErrorReason":{"enum":["ENTITY_NOT_FOUND"],"type":"string"},"SponsoredProductsEntityQuotaError":{"description":"Errors related to exceeding quota in campaign management service","properties":{"cause":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/SponsoredProductsErrorCause"},"entityType":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/SponsoredProductsEntityType"},"message":{"description":"Human readable error message","type":"string"},"quota":{"description":"optional current quota","type":"string"},"quotaScope":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/SponsoredProductsQuotaScope"},"reason":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/SponsoredProductsQuotaErrorReason"}},"required":["entityType","message","reason"],"type":"object"},"SponsoredProductsEntityState":{"description":"The current resource state.\n| State | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `ENABLED` | Enabled State |\n| `PAUSED` | Paused State |\n| `PROPOSED` | Proposed State (Upcoming Feature) |\n| `ARCHIVED` | ARCHIVED State |\n| `ENABLING` | State for Draft Entity Only |\n| `USER_DELETED` | State for Draft Entity Only |\n| `OTHER` | Read Only |","enum":["ARCHIVED","ENABLED","ENABLING","OTHER","PAUSED","PROPOSED","USER_DELETED"],"type":"string"},"SponsoredProductsEntityStateError":{"description":"entity state update errors","properties":{"cause":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/SponsoredProductsErrorCause"},"entityType":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/SponsoredProductsEntityType"},"marketplace":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/SponsoredProductsMarketplace"},"message":{"description":"Human readable error message","type":"string"},"reason":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/SponsoredProductsEntityStateErrorReason"}},"required":["entityType","message","reason"],"type":"object"},"SponsoredProductsEntityStateErrorReason":{"enum":["ARCHIVED_ENTITY_CANNOT_BE_MODIFIED","AUTO_TARGETING_CLAUSE_CANNOT_BE_ARCHIVED_MANUALLY","INVALID_STATE_TRANSITION","INVALID_TARGET_STATE","MARKETPLACE_STATE_CANNOT_BE_ARCHIVED","PARENT_ARCHIVED_FORBIDS_UPDATES","PARENT_ENTITY_FORBIDS_CREATION","PARENT_STATUS_FORBIDS_UPDATES_AND_CREATES"],"type":"string"},"SponsoredProductsEntityStateFilter":{"description":"Filter entities by state.
