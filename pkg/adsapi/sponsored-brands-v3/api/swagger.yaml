        API to poll for media status.
        In order to attach media to campaign, media should be in either `PendingDeepValidation` or `Available` status.

        `Available` status guarantees that media has completed processing and published for usage.

        Though media can be attached to campaign once the status of the media transitions to `PendingDeepValidation`, media could still fail additional validation and transition to `Failed` status. For example in the context of SBV, SBV campaign can be created when status transitions to `PendingDeepValidation`, it could result in SBV campaign to be rejected later if media transitions to `Failed` status.

        \n**Constraints of Sponsored Brands reporting**\n\nSponsored Brands reporting\
        \ data cannot be combined with Sponsored Products data into one report. Only\
        \ 14-day data is available for Sponsored Brands. Attribution windows of 1,\
        \ 7, and 30-day intervals are not available.\n\n**New-to-brand performance\
        \ metrics**\n\nWith new-to-brand metrics, advertisers can measure and optimize\
        \ campaigns, as well as plan future marketing strategies to grow their customer\
        \ base on Amazon. New-to-brand metrics determine whether an ad-attributed\
        \ purchase was made by an existing customer or one buying a brandâ€™s product\
        \ on Amazon for the first time over the prior year. With new-to-brand metrics,\
        \ advertisers receive campaign performance metrics such as total new-to-brand\
        \ purchases and sales, new-to-brand purchase rate, and cost per new-to-brand\
        \ customer. Advertisers now have the tools they need to estimate the cost\
        \ of acquiring new customers on Amazon and identify the most efficient channels\
        \ and tactics to achieve their campaign goals."
