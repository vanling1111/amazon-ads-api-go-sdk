// SponsoredProductsPlacement : You can enable controls to adjust your bid based on the placement location. Specify a location where you want to use bid controls. The percentage value set is the percentage of the original bid for which you want to have your bid adjustment increased. For example, a 50% Top of Search adjustment on a $1.00 bid would increase the bid to $1.50 for the opportunity to win a Top of Search placement. A further 100% Amazon Business adjustment would increase the bid to $3.00 for the Amazon Business Top of Search placement and to $2.00 for all other Amazon Business placements. The Amazon Business Bid Adjustment and Reporting for Sponsored Products will be coming soon to Bulksheets. | Predicate |  Placement | |-----------|------------| | `PLACEMENT_TOP` | Top of search (first page) | | `PLACEMENT_PRODUCT_PAGE` | Product pages | | `PLACEMENT_REST_OF_SEARCH` | Rest of the search | | `SITE_AMAZON_BUSINESS` | Site Amazon Business |
