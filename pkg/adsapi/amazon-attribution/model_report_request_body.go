 * **Amazon Attribution**<br/>    Amazon Attribution is an advertising measurement product that enables advertisers to understand the impact that their non-Amazon ads (i.e. Google Ads, Facebook, Microsoft Ads) have in driving shopping activity on Amazon. Measuring ads using Amazon Attribution is done through implementing Attribution tags on non-Amazon ads. Amazon Attribution is currently available in beta for US, CA, UK, DE, FR, IT, and ES vendors and professional sellers enrolled in Brand Registry.<br/><br/>    **Amazon Attribution API**<br/>    The Amazon Attribution API enables agencies and integrators to easily retrieve their advertiser client's non-Amazon publisher attribution tags to automate tag implementation on their non-Amazon ads that link to an Amazon product or Stores page. The API also enables agencies and integrators to create and retrieve reporting on behalf of their advertiser clients to better understand Amazon conversion performance on their campaigns.<br/><br/>    Note that you must pass a header named **Amazon-Advertising-Api-Scope** with each call to an  Amazon Attribution API URI, including GET /advertisers. The value for this header is the **profileId** available from the **Profiles resource (/v2/profiles)**.<br/><br/>    For more information on the functionality, see the [Amazon Attribution API help topic](amazon-attribution/overview). For API onboarding information, see the [account setup](setting-up/account-setup) topic.<br/><br/>**</br></br>[Amazon Advertising API Support JIRA Service Desk - Website](https://amzn-clicks.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/user/login?destination=portals)</br>[Amazon Advertising API License Agreement](https://advertising.amazon.com/API/docs/license-agreement)

// Report request body.  Two types of reports are available: Performance or Products - choose by including the `reportType` property. Performance report may be aggregated at any of three levels: campaign, ad group, or creative - choose by including the `groupBy` property. Products report is always aggregated at ad group level - when requesting a Products report, do not include the `groupBy` property or an error will occur.  Pagination is recommended - include the `count` and `cursorId` properties.  Pass a list of metrics to control which metrics appear in the response, or omit this list to receive all available metrics (except brb_bonus_amount).  Dimensions available within each report type and aggregation level: | reportType  | groupBy  | Dimensions| |-------------|-------------------|-----------| |PERFORMANCE|CREATIVE|campaignId, adgroupId, creativeid, publisher| |PERFORMANCE|ADGROUP|campaignId, adgroupId, publisher| |PERFORMANCE|CAMPAIGN|campaignId| |PRODUCTS|N/A|campaignId, adgroupId, publisher, productName, productGroup, productCategory, productSubcategory, brandName, productAsin, productConversionType| Example requests: ```  # PerformanceReportGroupedAtCampaignLevel {   \"reportType\": \"PERFORMANCE\",   \"endDate\": \"20220601\",   \"count\": 1000,   \"startDate\": \"20220525\",   \"groupBy\":\"CAMPAIGN\" }  # ProductsReport  {   \"reportType\": \"PRODUCTS\",   \"endDate\": \"20220601\",   \"count\": 1000,   \"startDate\": \"20220525\" } ```

	// A comma-delimited list of metrics to include in the report. In the report, each metric’s value reflects the events which took place on the row’s date; in other words, events are reported on the date they occurred, not on the date of the attributed click. Attribution is calculated using a 14-day last-click model.
