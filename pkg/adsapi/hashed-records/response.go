/*
 * Hashed Records
 *
 * Amazon DSP users can now use the hashed records API through the Amazon Advertising API to match Amazon shoppers with their hashed customer records including name, email, mobile, address, and zip code. Advertisers can further use the data provider APIs (https://advertising.amazon.com/API/docs/en-us/data-provider/openapi#/) to programmatically create audiences for use in their campaigns by their owned or sourced hashed customer records.
 *
 * API version: 3.0
 * Generated by: Swagger Codegen (https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen.git)
