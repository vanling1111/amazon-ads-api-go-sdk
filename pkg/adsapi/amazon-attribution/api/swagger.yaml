  title: Amazon Attribution
  description: "**Amazon Attribution**<br/>    Amazon Attribution is an advertising\
    \ measurement product that enables advertisers to understand the impact that their\
    \ non-Amazon ads (i.e. Google Ads, Facebook, Microsoft Ads) have in driving shopping\
    \ activity on Amazon. Measuring ads using Amazon Attribution is done through implementing\
    \ Attribution tags on non-Amazon ads. Amazon Attribution is currently available\
    \ in beta for US, CA, UK, DE, FR, IT, and ES vendors and professional sellers\
    \ enrolled in Brand Registry.<br/><br/>    **Amazon Attribution API**<br/>   \
    \ The Amazon Attribution API enables agencies and integrators to easily retrieve\
    \ their advertiser client's non-Amazon publisher attribution tags to automate\
    \ tag implementation on their non-Amazon ads that link to an Amazon product or\
    \ Stores page. The API also enables agencies and integrators to create and retrieve\
    \ reporting on behalf of their advertiser clients to better understand Amazon\
    \ conversion performance on their campaigns.<br/><br/>    Note that you must pass\
    \ a header named **Amazon-Advertising-Api-Scope** with each call to an  Amazon\
    \ Attribution API URI, including GET /advertisers. The value for this header is\
    \ the **profileId** available from the **Profiles resource (/v2/profiles)**.<br/><br/>\
    \    For more information on the functionality, see the [Amazon Attribution API\
    \ help topic](amazon-attribution/overview). For API onboarding information, see\
    \ the [account setup](setting-up/account-setup) topic.<br/><br/>**</br></br>[Amazon\
